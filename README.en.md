[![License: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-PolyForm%20Noncommercial%201.0.0-blue)](./LICENSE)

Kun is a next-generation desktop app for developers, creators, and frequent AI users. It brings a local agent runtime, project workspaces, a writing workbench, IM automation, planning/goals/review, and multimodal capabilities into one product: choose a workspace, start a task, watch reasoning and tool calls stream in, review file changes, and approve sensitive actions when needed.

Kun ships with presets for three highly cost-efficient model providers: DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax, while keeping provider profiles editable for compatible services. The goal is not another chat wrapper. It is to build the coolest AI application product: models that can reliably participate in real projects, long-form writing, team messages, and automated work, with each call turned into visible progress.

## Why Kun Is Fast, Stable, And Efficient

Kun makes token economy and context stability the default behavior of the agent loop, not a cleanup step after the fact. It does more than compress text: before each model call, it decides which information is worth entering context.

| Kun advantage | Where the ROI comes from |
| --- | --- |
| **Stable prefixes** | Stable system prompts, tool schemas, and immutable prefixes help upstream models with cache support reuse long-session background. |
| **Tool context on demand** | When MCP catalogs are large, Kun can search for relevant tools first, then describe and call the target tool instead of sending every tool schema on every turn. |
| **Context hygiene** | Long tool results, long arguments, base64 payloads, repeated tool loops, and low-value history are bounded while code, paths, errors, decisions, and open tasks are preserved. |
| **Visible usage payback** | Runtime telemetry tracks cache hit/miss, token usage, and estimated savings; the GUI surfaces Token economy savings so cost return is observable over time. |

The result: Kun is built for real project work with long tasks, long sessions, and many tools. It keeps the model's attention on high-value context, helping the same API budget produce more useful progress.

## What We Built

- A desktop app around the Kun local runtime, with default runtime auto-start and management.
- A full chat workbench with multiple sessions, streaming output, history, interruption, and resend flows.
- Local workspace integration so the agent can read, edit, and create files in real projects.
- Change review surfaces that make every file modification visible and inspectable.
- First-run onboarding, settings, language/theme/font controls, notifications, local logs, and update entry points.
- DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax provider presets, with API key and Token Plan access modes plus editable custom compatible services.
- Graphical Skill and MCP management so users can extend the agent without hand-editing every config file.
- Connect phone automation with Feishu / Lark / WeChat integration, dedicated IM agents, local webhook / relay support, and scheduled tasks.
- A dedicated Write workbench with writing spaces, a Markdown file tree, live editing/preview, inline completion, selection-based inline agent actions, and image generation entry points.
- New requirement drafts, plans, thread todos, long-running goals, and code review so tasks can move from idea to execution to review.
- Pre-built macOS, Windows, and Linux installers; source builds remain available.

## Highlights

- **Desktop chat workbench**: multi-session chat with streamed replies, reasoning, tool calls, approval requests, and file changes in one place.
- **Project workspaces**: choose a local directory for each task, organize sessions by workspace, preview files, open files in your editor, and pick Git branches.
- **New requirements**: draft background, goals, and acceptance criteria; ask Requirement AI to clarify missing questions or research options; then generate an implementation plan.
- **Plans and todos**: `/plan` and New requirement both create editable plan files, while the right-side Plan panel syncs thread todos for trackable execution.
- **Goals**: `/goal` sets a long-running objective for the current thread, with pause, resume, clear, and complete states so the agent can keep working toward the same outcome.
- **Code review**: `/review` can inspect current uncommitted changes, a base branch diff, a commit, or custom review instructions, with findings shown as review cards.
- **Side conversations and thread control**: `/btw` opens a context-inheriting side conversation; threads also support compact, fork, archive, and restore flows.
- **Change review**: inline diffs and a side review panel help you understand exactly what the agent changed.
- **Controlled permissions**: choose read-only, workspace-write, full-access, or external sandbox modes, and decide when tool calls require approval.
- **Managed runtime**: use the bundled Kun by default, or point the app at your own `kun` executable.
- **Three provider presets**: DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, and MiniMax are built in, with API keys, Token Plan keys, editable model lists, Base URL overrides, and custom providers.
- **Multimodal capabilities**: image attachments, vision model input, Xiaomi MiMo speech recognition, and MiniMax image generation can be reused by chat, Write, and IM agents according to settings.
- **Skill and MCP support**: create Skills, edit MCP config, add common tools, and open the related folders from the UI.
- **Feature-flagged agent extensions**: Kun can enable MCP, web fetch/search, Skills, standalone CLI use, image attachments, cross-session memory, and delegated subagents by config; Settings shows the runtime-reported capability and diagnostics state.
- **Connect phone**: run a background agent alongside normal chat, with current support for Feishu / Lark / WeChat, IM webhook / relay flows, and scheduled tasks.
- **Scheduled tasks**: create one-time, daily, interval, or manual tasks with their own workspace, model, and reasoning effort so Kun can run while the computer is awake.
- **Write mode**: manage `~/.kun/write_workspace` and custom writing spaces, browse Markdown files, use live Markdown editing, preview relative images, get short completion / inspiration completion with optional cross-document BM25 + keyword retrieval, export the current document as `HTML / PDF / DOC / DOCX`, and invoke the writing assistant directly from selected text.
- **High token ROI**: Kun keeps prompt prefixes stable, tracks provider cache hit/miss fields, compacts context and tool output, and uses MCP search to discover tools progressively so tokens stay focused on requirements, code, decisions, and results.
- **Friendly first launch**: choose language and provider, add a DeepSeek / Xiaomi MiMo / MiniMax API key or Token Plan key, and optionally set a compatible Base URL.
- **Local-first**: preferences, sessions, logs, and runtime config stay on your machine; model calls use your own provider credentials.
- **English and Chinese UI**: switch languages from Settings at any time.
- **Cross-platform use**: macOS `.dmg/.zip`, Windows `.exe`, and Linux `.AppImage`; source builds remain available.

## Runtime: Kun

The local agent runtime in the Kun desktop app is the bundled
TypeScript package of the same name — **Kun** (shipped under `kun/`).
It boots a local HTTP/SSE server as the single boundary between the GUI
and the agent loop: the GUI owns the visual workbench, approvals, and
interaction, while the runtime owns model calls, tools, persistence,
context compaction, and usage accounting.

Kun's operating principle is to raise the ROI of every token. The
user's context budget should go toward requirements, code, decisions,
and results, not repeated tool schemas, runaway tool output, invalid
history, or prefixes that could have been reused from cache. It is
optimized less for one-off questions and more for real workflows that
read and write projects, call tools repeatedly, and carry context over
long sessions.

Key runtime capabilities include:

- **Stable prefixes and usage telemetry**: immutable prompt prefix with sha256 fingerprints, append-only session logs, bounded TTL/LRU caches, inflight tracking, mid-turn steering queues, context compaction, and cache/usage telemetry.
- **Provider-aware model layer**: provider profiles manage DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, MiniMax, and custom compatible services, including endpoint formats, model profiles, reasoning effort, vision input, speech recognition, and image generation.
- **Token economy and tool-context optimization**: Kun stabilizes system prompts and tool schemas, reads provider-returned cache/usage fields, bounds long tool results, long arguments, base64 payloads, and repeated tool loops, and can use `mcp_search` / `mcp_describe` / `mcp_call` to discover MCP tools progressively.

For the dedicated write-up on cache behavior, including stable
prefixes, tool schema canonicalization, cache hit/miss accounting,
tool-pair healing, and validation strategy, see
[`docs/kun-cache-optimization.en.md`](docs/kun-cache-optimization.en.md).

Kun's larger agent capabilities are controlled by feature flags:
`capabilities.mcp` connects third-party MCP servers,
`capabilities.web` exposes `web_fetch` / `web_search`,
`capabilities.skills` discovers `skill.json` and legacy `SKILL.md`,
`capabilities.attachments` enables image attachments with text-model fallback, `capabilities.memory`
enables cross-session recall, and `capabilities.subagents` allows
budgeted delegated child runs. `kun run`, `kun chat`, and `kun exec`
can run without the GUI. The GUI reads `/v1/runtime/info` and
`/v1/runtime/tools` in Settings to show what is actually available.
These capabilities are off by config or limited by model capability
until explicitly enabled; examples and troubleshooting live in
[`kun/README.md`](kun/README.md).

Simplified architecture:

```text
Renderer (React)
  → KunRuntimeProvider
  → preload: kunGui.runtimeRequest / startSse
  → main: LocalHttpRuntimeAdapter
  → kun serve (HTTP + SSE)
  → cache-first AgentLoop
```

Settings live under **Settings → Agent runtime** and **Settings → Model providers**:
binary path, port, auto-start, provider, API key / Token Plan key,
base URL, runtime token, data dir, model, approval policy, sandbox
mode, the insecure switch, and speech / image-generation capabilities.

The full endpoint list, CLI flags, environment variables, data dir
layout, and SSE event schema are documented in
[`kun/README.md`](kun/README.md).

## Who It Is For

- Developers who want AI to work on real codebases without living in a terminal.
- Teams that need to see what the agent did, which files changed, and which operations required approval.
- Users who maintain multiple projects or long-running conversations and want reusable Skill/MCP setup.
- Anyone who wants one desktop app for DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, MiniMax, and custom compatible services.

## Workbench And Entry Points

Kun is centered on two main workbenches, **Code** and **Write**,
with additional entry points for **Connect phone**, **Scheduled tasks**,
and **Plugins / Skills / MCP**. They share the same Kun runtime and
settings, but keep sessions, workspaces, and layouts separate so you
can switch by task.

### Code Mode

The development workbench for real codebases: bind a local project directory, read and edit files, run commands, and review changes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/codemode.png" alt="Kun Code mode" width="860">
</p>

- Organize multiple agent sessions by workspace, with streamed reasoning, tool calls, and file changes in one view.
- Inline diffs, a change-review panel, and permission modes from read-only to full access.
- New requirement drafts, `/plan`, the right-side Plan panel, thread todos, and `/goal` help complex work move from clarification to planning to execution.
- `/review`, `/btw`, thread compaction, thread forking, archive, and restore support longer-lived project conversations.
- Quick-start cards for common tasks such as project mapping, bug fixing, implementation planning, and UI polish.

### Write Mode

A dedicated Markdown writing workbench that keeps writing files, save state, and AI assistance separate from Code sessions.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/writemode.png" alt="Kun Write mode" width="860">
</p>

- Manage `~/.kun/write_workspace` plus custom writing spaces from the left file tree.
- Switch between **Live / Source / Split / Preview**; Live keeps Markdown source on the active line and renders the rest.
- Export the current Markdown document from the toolbar as `HTML / PDF / DOC / DOCX`, with best-effort preservation for headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and local images.
- Short and inspiration completion, plus selection-based inline agent actions and a right-side writing assistant for summaries, outlines, and polish.

### Connect Phone

Background automation and IM integration, so Kun can keep handling phone messages and scheduled jobs outside normal desktop chat.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/clawmode.png" alt="Kun Connect phone" width="860">
</p>

- Configure dedicated agents for Feishu / Lark / WeChat and other channels, each with its own profile, default model, and workspace.
- Every IM agent gets its own thread, so you can debug replies and tool calls directly in the GUI.
- Local webhook / relay support for connecting Kun to team workflows and personal automation.
- Scheduled tasks can run once, daily, on an interval, or manually. Each task creates a dedicated Kun thread and sends its configured prompt.

## Install

### Download a Pre-built Package

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/KunAgent/Kun/releases):

| Platform | Package |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `.dmg` or `.zip`, Intel and Apple Silicon |
| Windows | `.exe`, NSIS installer, x64 |
| Linux | `.AppImage`, x64 |

On first launch, choose DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, or MiniMax, then enter the related API key / Token Plan key. If you use a compatible service, you can also edit the Base URL and model list in Settings.

### Run from Source

For contributors and local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunAgent/Kun.git
cd Kun
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- At least one model-provider API key or Token Plan key
- Internet access during the first dependency install

For slower network access in mainland China, use an npm mirror:

```bash
npm install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

---

## First Run

1. Open Kun.
2. Choose your interface language in the onboarding guide.
3. Choose DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, or MiniMax, then enter an API key / Token Plan key; set a custom Base URL if needed.
4. Choose a default workspace, or use the default directory created by the app.
5. Start a new session and describe the task you want the agent to handle.

Typical flow (**Code mode**):

- Pick or switch a workspace from the sidebar.
- Describe the task in the composer.
- Watch reasoning, tool calls, command execution, and file changes as they happen.
- Allow or deny actions that require approval.
- Inspect changes in the review panel before deciding what to do next.

See [Workbench And Entry Points](#workbench-and-entry-points) above for Connect phone and Write details. Quick start:

- **Connect phone**: enable background automation in Settings → add a Feishu / Lark / WeChat connection → configure agent profile, model, and workspace → optionally enable webhook / relay or scheduled tasks.
- **Write**: switch to Write mode → use the default writing space or add a new one → write in the Live editor with completion, selection inline agent, and the right-side writing assistant.

## Usage and Settings

Settings manages:

- DeepSeek / Xiaomi MiMo / MiniMax providers, API keys / Token Plan keys, Base URLs, model lists, runtime port, and runtime token.
- Auto-start for the local runtime, plus optional custom `kun` path.
- Tool approval policy and filesystem access mode.
- Default workspace, language, theme, font size, and completion notifications.
- GUI updates and local error logs.
- Skill creation, Skill folders, and MCP config editing.
- Speech recognition, image generation, image attachments, and vision model input.
- Connect phone automation, Feishu / Lark / WeChat connections, webhook / relay settings, and scheduled tasks.

Keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline in composer |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send message |
| `Esc` | Close a panel or dismiss the current overlay |

## Write Mode Design Notes

Write mode extends Kun from a code/chat workbench into a long-form writing workspace. Its implementation borrows several ideas from the local `openhanako` reference project:

- Markdown live editing: openhanako inspired the CodeMirror decorations approach where the active line stays editable as Markdown source while inactive lines render headings, tasks, images, dividers, and tables through widgets.
- Selection inline agent: openhanako inspired the selection-capture and floating-input interaction, so selected text can be sent with file path, line numbers, and bounded original text as structured context.
- AI session isolation: Write uses Kun threads, but the GUI keeps a local write thread registry per writing space so write conversations do not pollute Code / Connect phone sidebars.
- Text completion: writing completion uses a dedicated low-latency completion path so it does not block the local Kun serve agent loop. Short completion uses a short debounce, small token budget, and strict local filtering; inspiration completion uses a longer pause, larger token budget, and only runs at line ends or paragraph boundaries. Before completion, the app builds a short-TTL lightweight index over Markdown / text files in the writing space, retrieves cross-document snippets with BM25 + keyword matching, and injects them as a hidden Markdown comment so terminology, facts, and style stay consistent.

## Uninstall

> New installers use `Kun` as the application name. If older local data exists, the app migrates it on first launch.

### Windows

- Open Settings -> Apps -> Installed apps, find `Kun`, and uninstall it.
- Or uninstall from Control Panel -> Programs and Features.
- Or run the uninstaller from the installation directory.

The Windows installer creates Start Menu and desktop shortcuts by default. It does not force a taskbar pin; pin it manually from the Start Menu if you want one.

### macOS

- Move `Kun.app` from Applications to Trash.
- If macOS blocks the app on first open, right-click it in Finder and choose Open.
- For local unsigned builds, you can remove the quarantine attribute first:

```bash
npm run mac:unquarantine -- '/Applications/Kun.app'
```

### Linux

- If you built a Linux package from source, delete the related `.AppImage` or installed files.
- If you manually created a desktop entry or shortcut, delete that too.

### Remove Local Data

By default, uninstalling removes the app but keeps local settings, sessions, and runtime config so reinstalling is smoother. For a full cleanup, remove these paths if needed:

| Platform | App data path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Kun` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Kun` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Kun` |

Kun data lives under `~/.kun/data` or the configured Kun data dir. Check it before deleting, because it may contain sessions, MCP, or Skill settings you still need.

---

## Updates

- For regular users: check GUI updates in Settings or download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/KunAgent/Kun/releases).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for bug fixes, UI/UX improvements, documentation, localization, build/release workflows, and runtime integration.

Project conventions:

- Day-to-day collaboration and integration happens on `develop`; stable releases land on `master`.
- Start features and fixes from the latest `develop`, preferably on a short-lived feature branch.
- Open pull requests into `develop` by default; maintainers merge reviewed changes into `master` for release.
- Align on scope first for larger or riskier changes.
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` before opening a PR.
- Include a video or GIF when the UI changes.
- Include unit tests when project logic changes.
- Update both `README.md` and `README.en.md` when usage changes.
- External contributions require acceptance of the [Contributor License Agreement](./CLA.md), so project licensing can remain centrally managed by the project owner.
